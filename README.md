Windows Systems Administration Project
This project documents real operational tasks performed in a Systems Administrator capacity, focusing on the maintenance, security hardening and backup readiness of Windows-based endpoints.

The objective was to improve system performance, enhance endpoint security and ensure recoverability through structured administration tasks.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview
As part of ongoing IT operations, the following actions were completed:

User Management:
Created and managed local user accounts using CLI tools, configured administrative permissions and enforced secure password policies.

Endpoint Security Hardening:
Disabled USB storage device access through Registry modifications to prevent unauthorised data transfer and mitigate malware threats.

Scheduled Maintenance Automation:
Developed and deployed automated PowerShell tasks to clean temporary system files and optimise workstation performance.

Backup and Recovery Planning:
Created manual system restore points before critical system changes to ensure rapid recovery in the event of system issues.

System Health Monitoring:
Performed system health checks using Event Viewer, Task Manager and Resource Monitor to proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

Technical Documentation:
Produced detailed handover procedures for managing local users, ensuring operational continuity across support teams.
